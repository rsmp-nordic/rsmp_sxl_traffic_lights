Multiple supervisors
====================

If RSMP version 3.2 or later is used then the TLC needs to support multiple supervisors
according to section `4.2.1 Multiple supervisors <https://rsmp-nordic.org/rsmp_specifications/core/3.2applicability/transport_of_data.html#multiple-supervisors>`_
in the RSMP specification.
